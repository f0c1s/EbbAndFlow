What is reactive programming?

	It's the latest buzzword to sell you books.
	It's invented to make you feel that you don't know programming, so that HR can decrease your salary/package.

	But before that:
		What is a constant?
		What is a variable?
		What is a list? (array)
		What is a file?
		What is a process?
		What is a stream?
		What is a pipe?

	There are two kinds of money: one you can put in a bag; other you cannot.
		What are the challenges involved in keeping 10 Million Indian Rupees with you?
		What are the challenges involved in keeping same amount in bank account?

	In terms of observing changes to program state:
		What are variables or constants?
		What are pipes and streams?

	Would you rather stand by the microwave owen for 10 minutes, or would you let it notify you when it's done?
	Would you rather stand by the washing machine for 30 minutes, or would you rather let it notify you after it is done washing and drying?

	The concept of declarative vs imperative.
		Imperative - specify your actions; (and mostly do them now)
		Declarative - specify your intentions; (and mostly do them when you get to them)

	Making a cucumber salad imperatively:
		let fastFood = orderFastFood()
		let cucumbers = getCucumbersFrom(supermarket)
		let washedCucumbers = wash(cucumbers)
		let cutCucumbers = cut(washedCucumbers)
		let saltedCucumbers = salt(cutCucumbers)
		let masalaCucumbers = apply(masala, saltedCucumbers)
		let servedCucumbers = serve(masalaCucumbers)
		let food = dayIsSaturday ? servedCucumbers : fastFood;

		if (whenReadyToEat && dayIsSaturday) {
			eat(food)
		} else {
			eat(open(food))
		}

	Making a cucumber salad declaratively:
		let cucumbers = supermarket.whenThere().filter(cucumbersOnSaturday).buyFood()
		let salad = cucumbers.forAll().process(item => item.wash().cut().salt().applyMasala())
		let readyPlate = salad.serve()

        let fastFood = supermarket.whenThere().filter(otherwiseFastFood).buyFood()
        let readyPlate = fastFood.forEach().open()
		
        let food = (Either salad OR fastFood)
        food.eat()    
        
        When you call `food.eat()`, then you understand power of lazy.
        You might have gone to supermarket earlier or you might have to go now.
        This is different from imperative, because there you must have gone to supermarket already.


	FP
	- declarative
	- immutable data; mostly

	Reactive Functional example: ReactiveCocoa

    Reactive = Oberserver Pattern + Iterator Pattern + Error Notification + Complete/Done Notification
